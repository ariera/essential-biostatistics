# About
Small coding exercises or empirical demonstrations of some of the concepts show in [Essential Biostatistics - A nonmathematical Approach](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25923604-essential-biostatistics) by [Harvey Motulsky](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/25/harvey-motulsky).

As I work through the book I find moments in which I think "Ah! That's something I would like to do by myself". This is what this repo is about :)

## Install
You need python 3. Follow these steps to create a new python virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements
```
